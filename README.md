# ğŸ”ƒ Component Source Updates
Scanner for Component Source Updates

For this tool the term "Components" aims at files, e.g. source code files, which are not managed or installed via a packet management system, which could take care of versioning.
Typical examples are:

* Small software utilities without installers, (aka, portable, download and unzip)
* C++ libraries / header-only libraries which are integrated into a project by being copied into it

Those components still have an official source, like a Github project, hosting new releases.
This scanner utility scans your file system for _Component-Source Manifest_ files, specifying those sources for such components.
It will then scan the sources for updates, report the findings, and notifies the user.

This tool is close in spirit to Component Governance and Dependency scanner applications.
